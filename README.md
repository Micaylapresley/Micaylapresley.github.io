My portfolio uses CSS, HTML, jquery, and JSON. 
The Data Visualization process has been described in the README.md in the repo.
My resume' is linked to the first button beneath my brief description in PDF format.
My Overstack account, Github account, and Data Visualization are all linked to the buttons on the bottom.
I used HTML inline format to insert a snip of my Data Visualization chart in the canvas just beneath the button for the Zagster Data Visualization.
I also used inline to alter the font sizes, colors, families, and styles.
